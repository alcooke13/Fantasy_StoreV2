# Fantasy_StoreV2

A react application where the user is managing a store, selling products usually found in a fantasy setting. This is an updated version of my first coding project. <br>
Version 1.0: https://github.com/alcooke13/fantasy_store_project

Technologies used:
- Java
- JavaScript
- React
- Java Spring Boot
- PostgreSQL

Why did I do this? <br>

There were some things that I didn't manage to implement in version 1.0, so I always wanted to go back to the project and finalise everything. However after using React in my other projects, I really wanted to continue using it to develop web apps. 
So I decided to leave version 1.0 as is and instead create this 2.0 version. Where I'll get more experience using Java and React as well as improve the overall CSS of the application creating a more user friendly and responsive final product.
